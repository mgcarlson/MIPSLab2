# MIPSLab2
MIPS code from lab assignment project, getting familiar with functionality of assembly language
These are four separate files each with different functionalities, which are listed in the comments of the code (comments not made by myself). 
This particular lab assigment in MIPS was designed to help me showcase my knowledge of the language thus far in my course, and determine
whether or not me and my lab group were able to decipher the problems given and construct code.
